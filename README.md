## MNIST Classifier using Python & numpy

### Overview:

The goal of this project was to understand the inner workings of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. To do this, I decided to build the Neural Network from scratch using only Python and numpy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### How to Use:

**Data preparation**: Ensure that the MNIST dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., /content/data/mnist_train.csv in your Colab notebook).

**Run the code**: Execute the Python script or notebook containing the code. The training process will be displayed, including the accuracy at each iteration.

**Evaluate performance**: After training, use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and assess its accuracy.

### Future Improvements:

**Experiment with different architectures**: Explore deeper networks, convolutional layers, or recurrent neural networks.

**Optimize hyperparameters**: Fine-tune the learning rate, number of epochs, and other parameters to improve performance.

**Implement regularization techniques**: Prevent overfitting by using techniques like dropout or L1/L2 regularization.
